Scripts for working with data for Olin's AC Reboot team.

## Getting Started

- if you have access to the data we're working with, copy/symlink it to `data/`
- check out [`nbdime`](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime) for managing notebook diffs
- consider using [`JupyterLab`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)
